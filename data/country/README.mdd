# Notes on country files
This folder contains three files:
* country.csv -- a table that can be ingested into the SQL database with a list of observed country names, iso codes and simplified names. Simplified country names were obtained from data provided at https://github.com/mledoze/countries
* countries.json -- a copy of the data downloaded from https://github.com/mledoze/countries. Note this is distributed under the ODbL-1.0 License
* add-common-country-names.pl -- a perl script that allows one to reproducibly update common names
